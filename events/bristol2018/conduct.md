# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version
The CCPBioSim team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of workshop attendees in any form at any time during the workshop event (including the workshops themselves *and* refreshment/lunch breaks, travelling to and from the workshops, at overnight accommodation while attending the workshops or online).

All communication should be appropriate for a professional event including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate during the workshops, whether as "banter", in discussion over coffee, at any evening events or online.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for these workshops.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the workshop at the sole discretion of the workshop organisers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## The Longer Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of training or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for this event.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the workshop organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop.

## Reporting harassment
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you should contact one of the workshop organisers. Should a harrassment incident take place, reporting should preferably be in writing. When reporting the incident, try to provide as much information as possible. A workshop organiser can assist you in writing the report or collecting the information. Please do not interview people about the incident, but leave this to a workshop organiser. Note that all reports will be confidential.

Important information to be recorded consists of:

* information about the attendee violating the code of conduct
* the behaviour that was in violation of the code of conduct
* approximate time and location of the incident
* the circumstances surrounding the incident
* other people involved in the incident

Workshop organisers are well-briefed on how to deal with the incident reports and on how to proceed further with the situation. Workshop organisers are happy to help attendees contact University security or the police, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the workshops.
