## Programme

### Monday 16th July

* Morning : Introduction to Jupyter, followed by Introduction to BioSimSpace

Introduction to Jupyter: Connect to the [workshop server](https://ccpbiosim.github.io/workshop/events/ccp52018/server.html)
and navigate to the `python_and_data` folder. This provides a menu of lessons in
Python. You only need to look at the `01_jupyter_howto.ipynb` lesson. You can look 
at other lessons if you have time, or if you are uncomfortable with Python.

Introduction to BioSimSpace : Continuing on the [workshop server](https://ccpbiosim.github.io/workshop/events/ccp52018/server.html)
navigate to the `biosimspace_workshop` folder. Follow the lessons in order from
`01_introduction.ipynb` to `04_molecular_setup.ipynb`.

* Afternoon : MD Analysis

Connect to the [workshop server](https://ccpbiosim.github.io/workshop/events/ccp52018/server.html)
and navigate to the `md_workshop` folder. All of the material is here, as will be
described during the lecture.

### Tuesday 17th July

* All day : [Visualising Binding Free Energies using Swap-Based Methods](https://ccpbiosim.github.io/xswaps/)
