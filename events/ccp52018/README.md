## Feedback

We are very interested in your comments about any aspect of the CCPBioSim contribution
to the CCP5 Summer School. Please use the below form to anonymously comment on any
aspect of our programme, e.g. the lectures or the practicals. You are the first people
to use parts of BioSimSpace, so we are particularly interested in your complaints,
comments and suggestions for BioSimSpace, and you experience of using these
cloud-based Jupyter notebooks for running simulations.

## Programme

### Monday 16th July

* Morning : Introduction to Jupyter, followed by Introduction to BioSimSpace

Introduction to Jupyter: Connect to the [workshop server](https://ccpbiosim.github.io/workshop/events/ccp52018/server.html)
and navigate to the `python_and_data` folder. This provides a menu of lessons in
Python. You only need to look at the `01_jupyter_howto.ipynb` lesson. You can look 
at other lessons if you have time, or if you are uncomfortable with Python.

Introduction to BioSimSpace : Continuing on the [workshop server](https://ccpbiosim.github.io/workshop/events/ccp52018/server.html)
navigate to the `biosimspace_workshop` folder. Follow the lessons in order from
`01_introduction.ipynb` to `04_molecular_setup.ipynb`.

* Afternoon : [Setting up and Running Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Good Practice and Pitfalls](https://ccpbiosim.github.io/md_workshop/)

### Tuesday 17th July

* All day : [Visualising Binding Free Energies using Swap-Based Methods](https://ccpbiosim.github.io/xswaps/)
